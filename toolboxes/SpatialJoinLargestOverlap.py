 Tool Name:   Spatial Join Largest Overlap
 Source Name: SpatialJoinLargestOverlap.py
 Version:     ArcGIS 10.1
 Author:      Esri, Inc.
 Required Arguments:
              Target Features (Feature Layer)
              Join Features (Feature Layer)
              Output Feature Class (Feature Class)
 Optional Arguments:
              Keep All (True|False)
              Spatial Relationship (String)

 Description: Joins attributes from one feature class to another based on the spatial
              relationship between the two. The target features and the
              attributes from the join features are written to the output feature
              class. This tool presents a new spatial relationship, Largest Overlap,
              where a target feature is joined to the join feature with the largest
              area or length of overlap.
